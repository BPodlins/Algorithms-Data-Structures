# ***Heap***

Heap is a data structure that bases on a tree data structure. We have a parent element, which has child elements.
Depending on what we choose to implement, different element is at the top: __max heap__ has the highest value element at the top
and __min heap__ has the smallest element at the top
<p>

In __Binary heap__ when we represent it as an 0 based array, then we can calculate child nodes.
If placing of parent node is represented by __i__ then left child is __2 * i + 1__ and right child is __2 * i + 2__
