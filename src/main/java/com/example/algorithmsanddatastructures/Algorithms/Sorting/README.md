# ***Insertion Sort***
Insertion sort works similarly to how you would sort cards in your hand. You begin with an empty hand, and then you add a card by comparing it with the ones that you already have in hand. You begin from right (end, the biggest cards).
It works the best with small amount of data to sort.
