# ***Radix Sort***

Radix sort is a linear time, non-comparative sorting algorithm.
It operates by distributing elements into buckets according to their individual digits.
The algorithm processes the digits from the least significant to the most significant,
and at each iteration, it collects the elements from the buckets to form a sorted sequence.
This process is repeated until all digits are considered. The key strength of Radix Sort
lies in its ability to handle fixed integers efficiently, making it well-suited for scenarios
where the length of the integers is constant, but also it takes additional space and does not work
