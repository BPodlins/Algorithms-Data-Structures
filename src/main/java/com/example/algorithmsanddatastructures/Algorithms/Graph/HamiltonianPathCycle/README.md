# ***Hamiltonian Paths and Circuits***

In graph theory, Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles represent fundamental concepts, offering solutions to the problem of visiting every vertex exactly once in a graph.
Named after Sir William Rowan Hamilton, these paths and cycles hold significance in diverse fields, including computer science, network analysis, and optimization.

## Definitions
 - Hamiltonian Path: A Hamiltonian Path in a graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. Unlike a Hamiltonian Cycle, the path does not have to return to the starting vertex.
 - Hamiltonian Cycle: A Hamiltonian Cycle is a closed loop in a graph that traverses through every vertex exactly once, returning to the starting vertex.

## Determining Hamiltonian Graphs:
Identifying whether a given graph contains a Hamiltonian Path or Cycle involves exploring various properties and employing different strategies:
1. Necessary Conditions:
    - For a graph to possess a Hamiltonian Path or Cycle, certain conditions must be met.
    - These conditions may include constraints on vertex degrees, connectivity, or structural properties.

2. Theorems and Algorithms:
   - Several theorems, such as Dirac's Theorem and Ore's Theorem, provide insights into the existence of Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles based on specific graph properties.
   - Algorithms, including backtracking and dynamic programming techniques, are often utilized to search for Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles in graphs.
