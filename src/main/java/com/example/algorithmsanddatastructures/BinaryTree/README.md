# Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is a fundamental hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. 
Binary Tree does not enforce any particular order among its elements. Although it still must be a tree, so there can't be any cycled nodes.



| Operation    | Time complexity                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Construction | O(n)                                     | 
| Search       | O(n)                                     | 
| Insert       | O(1), but only if the position is known  |    
| Delete       | O(1), but only if the position is known  |
