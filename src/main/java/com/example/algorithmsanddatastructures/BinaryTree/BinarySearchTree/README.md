# Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure that organizes elements in a way that facilitates efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. Each node in the tree has at most 
two child nodes: a left child and a right child.
Key thing is that all nodes in its left subtree have values smaller than the nodes value
, and vice-versa on the right side - all of them are "bigger".



| Operation                   | Time complexity<br/>Avarage | Time complexity<br/>Worst case |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Insert                      | O(log(n))                   | O(n)                           |
| Delete                      | O(log(n))                   | O(n)                           |
| Remove                      | O(log(n))                   | O(n)                           |   
| Search                      | O(log(n))                   | O(n)                           |
