# ***Stack***
Stack is a data structure that models a real life stack (like stack of plates).
Its main attribute is that it can only operate elements that are on the top. We use _push_
to put something on the stack, and _pop_ to take it off.
Stack works as __Last In First Out__

Stack Build on Linked list

| Operation          | Time complexity | 
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Push               | O(1)            |               
| Pop                | O(1)            |               
| Peek               | O(1)            |               
| Searching          | O(n)            |
