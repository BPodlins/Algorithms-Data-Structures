# ***Hash Table***
A hash table is a data structure that provides a way to store and retrieve values based on a key.
It works by using a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.
Each index in the array is called a bucket, and it can store multiple key-value pairs. 
In the context of a hashtable, we often refer to the key-value pair as an entry.

| Operation | Time complexity | 
|-----------|-----------------|
| Put       | O(1)*           |               
| Remove    | O(1)*           |               
| Search    | O(1)*           |               
| Resize    | O(n)            |
