# Segment Tree

A Segment Tree is a binary tree used for storing information about intervals, or segments. It allows for flexible and efficient querying of aggregate information over a range of data, such as sums or minimum/maximum values, while supporting updates. Segment Trees are particularly useful in areas such as computational geometry, and in competitive programming for solving range querying problems.

| Operation | Time Complexity    |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Build     | O(n)               |
| Query     | O(log n)           |
| Update    | O(log n)           |
